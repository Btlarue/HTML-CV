                    <p>One thing that you will get to know about me is that I like to dabble in many things. I have begun to start a home lab!
                        I have many ideas that I would like to get running, but I have only started the process. The wall mounted 9U rack, and terminal 
                        punching was done by me. In the future, I would like a linux virtual machine, PiHole, NAS, and Home Assistant all running on the network.

                        Progess will be updated soon!

                <p>I began 3D Printing in December 2022. I am very much a beginner, with every failure and mistake I learn a little more! I have the base Ender 3, and so far I have over 200

                        <li>Dual Z-axis rods</li>
                        <li>Ender Sprite extruder</li>
                        <li>CR-Touch auto bed level sensor</li>

                        <li>Flexible bed sheet</li>
                    </ul>
                    I have plans to install a silent motherboard, and a Raspberry Pi with Octoprint OS to enable network control over my printer.
